# Gomoku_Tournaments
Tournament Style training for an Reinforcement Learning AI to learn to play Gomoku. Running_Selfplay.ipynb is training an agent with self-play, with the example of a CQL agent that could be replaced by any other agents implemented in Running_Tournaments.ipynb. Running_Tournaments.ipynb runs the full tournament algorithm of Gomoku based an an instance of each of a DQN, single-net DQN, DDQN and CQL agent. Some of our code for the game play is based on this repo https://github.com/bokidigital/DQN_5x5_Gomoku
